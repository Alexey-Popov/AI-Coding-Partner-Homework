## Bug Summary

One-paragraph description of the bug: what fails, under what conditions, and observed vs expected behavior.

## Reproduction Path

Numbered steps to reproduce the bug from a clean state. Include exact commands.

## Code Findings

For each relevant file: file path, line range, quoted snippet, and what it reveals.
     Use exact file:line references for every claim.

## Root Cause Analysis

State the root cause precisely. Distinguish confirmed observations from hypotheses.
     Explain the mechanism: why the bug occurs, not just where.

## Proposed Fix Surface

Identify the minimum set of files and lines that need to change.
     Describe the smallest viable fix and any optional hardening.

## Risks and Edge Cases

What adjacent behavior could break? What inputs need special handling?
     List at least the cases the implementer must validate.

## Suggested Test Cases

List specific test cases a unit test generator should cover.
     Include at least one regression case for the original bug.

## References

List all files inspected, with paths relative to the repo root.
