# Implementation Plan: [BUG-ID]

  TEMPLATE — do not fill in this file inside context/bugs/XXX/

  This skeleton defines the output structure for the Bug Planner agent.
  Steps:
  1. Copy context/bugs/XXX/ to context/bugs/<YOUR-BUG-ID>/
  2. Run the Bug Planner agent — it will populate this file.

Generated by: bug-planner agent
Input required: research/verified-research.md with RQ-3 or RQ-4 and planning approved
Status: PENDING — fill in by running the Bug Planner agent

## Plan Summary

One paragraph: what will be changed, why, and the expected outcome.

## Preconditions

List what must be true before the implementer starts.
     Include: required artifact paths, environment, no pending conflicts.

## Files To Change

| File | Change Type |
|------|-------------|
| path| Add / Modify / Delete |

## Step-by-Step Changes

For each change: numbered step, file path, location (file:line), before behavior, after behavior.
     Do not paste full file contents — use concise before/after behavior summaries.

### Step 1: [title]

**File**: [path]
**Location**: [file:line]
**Before behavior**: [what the code does now]
**After behavior**: [what the code will do after the change]
**Change**:
```
minimal code diff or pseudocode showing what to change
```

## Test Commands

```bash
# Command to run after applying changes to verify the fix
```

## Validation Checklist

List specific assertions the implementer must confirm before writing fix-summary.md.

- [ ] <!-- assertion 1 -->
- [ ] <!-- assertion 2 -->

## Stop Conditions / Escalations

Define exact conditions under which the implementer must stop and report Blocked.
     E.g.: tests fail, assumptions don't hold, scope needs expanding.

## References

List all artifacts and files this plan is based on.
