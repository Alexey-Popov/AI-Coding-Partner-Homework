# Test Report: [BUG-ID]

  TEMPLATE — do not fill in this file inside context/bugs/XXX/

  This skeleton defines the output structure for the Unit Test Generator agent.
  Steps:
  1. Copy context/bugs/XXX/ to context/bugs/<YOUR-BUG-ID>/
  2. Run the Unit Test Generator agent — it will populate this file.

Generated by: unit-test-generator agent
Input required: fix-summary.md and changed files
Skill used: unit-tests-FIRST
Status: PENDING — fill in by running the Unit Test Generator agent

## Scope Under Test

Identify the specific functions / lines changed by the fix.
     List what is explicitly NOT in scope (unchanged code).

## Tests Added or Updated

| # | Test Name | Type | Expected Result |
|---|-----------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | | Regression / Success / Validation | |

**Test file(s)**: [path(s) relative to repo root]

## FIRST Assessment

For each letter: definition, evidence from the tests, Pass / Fail.

### F — Fast

**Definition**: Tests run in milliseconds; no network, no slow I/O.
**Evidence**: What makes these tests fast.
**Result**: Pass / Fail

### I — Independent

**Definition**: Each test creates fresh state; no shared mutable data between tests.
**Evidence**: How isolation is achieved.
**Result**: Pass / Fail

### R — Repeatable

**Definition**: Same result on every run and every environment.
**Evidence**: What makes tests deterministic.
**Result**: Pass / Fail

### S — Self-validating

**Definition**: Explicit assertions produce automatic pass/fail; no manual inspection.
**Evidence**: What assertions are used.
**Result**: Pass / Fail

### T — Timely

**Definition**: Tests cover the reported bug and only the new branches introduced by the fix.
**Evidence**: Which test covers the regression; which cover new validation.
**Result**: Pass / Fail
