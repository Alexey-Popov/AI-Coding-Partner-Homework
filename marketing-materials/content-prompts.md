# 📣 Marketing Content Prompts

Use these prompts with LLMs (Claude, GPT-4) to generate high-converting copy for the "AI as a Personalized Coding Partner" course.

## 1. LinkedIn: Persona-Specific Hooks

### For the "Overwhelmed Senior Engineer"
> **Prompt:** Write a LinkedIn post targeting senior software engineers who feel like they are drowning in routine tasks (PR reviews, boilerplate, unit tests). Contrast the 'old way' (manual work) with the 'AI-augmented way' taught in the "AI as a Personalized Coding Partner" course. Emphasize how mastering tools like Aider and Claude Code can give them back 10+ hours a week. Avoid the term 'vibe coding'. End with a call to action to check the course program.

### For the "Forward-Thinking Tech Lead"
> **Prompt:** Write a LinkedIn post for Tech Leads and Engineering Managers about standardizing AI workflows across a team. Mention the importance of `.cursorrules` and `AGENTS.md` for maintaining code quality. Explain that the "AI as a Personalized Coding Partner" course teaches how to build enterprise-grade multi-agent systems, not just simple chat prompts. Use a professional, authoritative tone.

### For the "Career Growth Architect"
> **Prompt:** Create a LinkedIn post about the transformation of software engineering. Argue that AI tools are no longer experimental but mandatory. Position the "AI as a Personalized Coding Partner" course as the definitive guide to becoming an 'AI-augmented engineer'. Focus on the Capstone project as a way to prove real-world capability.

## 2. Instagram/Threads: Punchy & Visual

### The "USB-C for AI" Analogy
> **Prompt:** Write a punchy Threads post explaining the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Use the analogy of a USB-C port. Explain how it lets you plug your AI directly into your database, files, and tools. Mention that our course has a dedicated module (Activity 7) on mastering MCP. Keep it under 500 characters.

### "Stop Chatting, Start Orchestrating"
> **Prompt:** Write 3 short, high-energy captions for Instagram Reels showing a screen recording of multi-agent coding (e.g., an Architect agent talking to an Editor agent). The theme is "Stop chatting with AI and start orchestrating agents." Mention the 5-agent Capstone project in the course.

## 3. Email Sequence: Nurture to Enrollment

### Email 1: The Problem (The Productivity Ceiling)
> **Prompt:** Draft an email to a developer who downloaded our "Essential MCP Server List". The subject should be about hitting a productivity ceiling. Acknowledge that tools are great, but workflows are better. Briefly introduce the Context → Model → Prompt framework.

### Email 2: The Solution (Multi-Agent Systems)
> **Prompt:** Draft an email explaining why a single AI isn't enough for complex features. Introduce the Architect-Editor pattern. Invite them to look at Activity 5 of the "AI as a Personalized Coding Partner" course.

### Email 3: The Proof (The Capstone Project)
> **Prompt:** Draft a final 'urgency' email focusing on the Capstone project. Explain that by the end of the course, they will have a working multi-agent banking system to show for their efforts. Include a summary of the 8 activities.
