# 🖼️ Visual & Video Generation Prompts

These prompts are designed to create attractive, high-quality assets for the course marketing campaign.

## 1. Static Image Prompts (Midjourney / DALL-E 3)

### The "USB-C for AI" (MCP Metaphor)
> **Prompt:** A high-quality 3D render of a futuristic, glowing USB-C cable plugging into a floating holographic brain. The cable is labeled "MCP". On the other side of the cable, various icons represent "Database", "Git", "Browser", and "Slack". Style: Clean, Apple-esque, minimalist, high-tech, white and electric blue color palette, soft studio lighting. 4k resolution.

### The Architect & Editor Agents
> **Prompt:** An isometric illustration of two robotic avatars working at a digital workbench. One avatar (The Architect) is holding a blueprint (labeled "SPEC"). The other avatar (The Editor) is using a laser to "carve" lines of code into a glowing screen. Style: Modern tech-art, vibrant gradients, cyberpunk-minimalist, depth of field.

### The Context-Model-Prompt Triad
> **Prompt:** A sophisticated infographic showing a glowing triangle. The three vertices are labeled "CONTEXT", "MODEL", and "PROMPT". In the center, a pulse of energy represents "ENGINEERING THROUGHPUT". Style: Vector art, dark mode UI aesthetic, clean typography, professional engineering look.

## 2. Video Generation Prompts (Runway Gen-3 / Luma Dream Machine)

### The "Agentic Evolution"
> **Prompt:** A cinematic transition. Start with a close-up of a developer's hands typing furiously on a keyboard in a dark room. The screen is filled with messy code. Suddenly, the perspective zooms out, and multiple glowing agent avatars appear around the developer, taking over different tasks. The messy code transforms into a clean, structured architecture. Text overlay: "From Coding to Orchestrating." Style: High-contrast, cinematic lighting, smooth camera motion.

### The "MCP Connector"
> **Prompt:** A motion graphics style video. A 3D Model of a "Claude" logo in the center. Multiple lines fly in from the edges of the screen, representing different data sources (Terminal, GitHub, Figma). They all click into the Claude logo like puzzle pieces. The logo glows brighter with every connection. Smooth, satisfying mechanical "click" movements.

### The Capstone Project (Multi-Agent Banking)
> **Prompt:** A fast-paced montage of a banking application dashboard being built "automagically". We see a "Fraud Detection Agent" scanning logs, a "Compliance Agent" checking rules, and a "Settlement Agent" processing transactions. All agents are represented by small, distinct glowing icons working in perfect synchronization.

## 3. GIF Concepts (for Emails and Landing Pages)

### "The AI Comment Magic"
- **Visual:** A snippet of code in VSCode. A user types `# Implement a transaction parser. AI!`.
- **Action:** A few seconds later, 20 lines of clean code "type themselves" into the file.
- **Goal:** To demonstrate the immediate value of Aider/Claude Code.

### "Architect passing the baton"
- **Visual:** A terminal window split in two.
- **Action:** Top half (Architect) outputs a JSON specification. Bottom half (Editor) reads the JSON and starts generating multiple files in a tree structure.
- **Goal:** To visualize the multi-agent workflow taught in Activity 5.
